This program generates 14 random points with x and y coordinates and classifies the points as being inside or outside of
a circle with a particular center and radius.  The output of this program is a plot of the outside points in purple and the inside points in green.

The point of this program was to get us into the "classification" mindset for machine learning (see KNN.R)
